# Celestial Bodies User Stories

## User Story 1:
* As a stargazing hobbyist, Celestial Bodies is a helpful app for knowing what's above me at any given time so I can watch them at night.
The app also displays how far away the object is and other cool facts about it. It's an invaluable for hobbyists like me.

## User Story 2: Astronomy Professor:

* As a college astronomy professor I want an app that identifies stars and constellations in real time and then documents the date and time that the constellation or star was located by a student.
